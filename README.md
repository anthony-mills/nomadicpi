## About Nomadic Pi

Rewrite of my original [Raspberry Pi based car computer](https://github.com/anthony-mills/raspberrypi-carputer) in Python with a QT based UI. 

The first iteration of the car computer while it has proven itself over 100,000km of travel. Caused others issues with the setup and was not the best choice of technologies for interfacing with other hardware.

So the first aim with this rewrite will be extensibility so it can be modified to interface with the multitude of bluetooth car accessories. The second goal will aim to ease of distribution and use for others. So this time around looking for a simplified .deb or similar installation workflow.
